## Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) Review

Original Source: [Stack Overflow Acceptable Use Policy](https://stackoverflow.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy)


Educational research involving data collection from the Stack Exchange Network must adhere to the guidelines specified within the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and the Public Network Terms of Service. The AUP states, 
> You may not use any automated data-gathering means (including robots, spiders, scrapers, crawlers, and the like) to gather any text, files, audio or visual media, profile information, or any other content from any Network website for any use that violates the Public Network Terms of Service, including the content license, or this Acceptable Use Policy.

Therefore, automated data collection for educational research is permissible under the condition that it does not contravene any stipulations of the Public Network Terms of Service or the AUP itself. This includes ensuring that the collection and use of data do not engage in or facilitate illegal use, spam, phishing, doxing, dissemination of malicious URLs, identity theft, disruptions and exploits, unauthorized use of intellectual property, mass registration and automation, distribution of sexually explicit material, framing, mirroring, or content scraping that breaches these provisions.
